# Rezifp Pharma Backup Strategy & Security Testing Lab
(Ficticious Organization)

<h2> Lab </h2>
In this lab, I focused on enhancing data resilience and securing backup processes at Rezifp Pharma Inc. following recent malware attacks.<br />

-  Full & Incremental Backup Implementation: Created daily full backups of critical data and validated backup integrity. Performed incremental backups to capture system changes.<br />
-  Data Restoration: Recovered missing patient files by inspecting and extracting data from backup archives, ensuring accurate restoration.<br />
-  Backup System Testing: Simulated cyberattacks to verify backup restoration and validate system functionality.<br />
-  Penetration Testing: Used wildpwn.py to identify potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the backup system and proposed mitigation strategies.<br />


<h2> Step 1: Creating the Backup Archive </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To ensure the critical data of the E-Prescription Treatment database is securely archived and readily available for restoration in case of data loss or malware attacks. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> Following the standard naming convention of Rezifp Pharma Inc., I will create a daily backup of the files located in the ~/Documents/epscript directory. Using the <b>tar cvvWf</b> command, I will compress and archive these files into a single tarball for secure storage. I will then use the <b>ls</b> command to confirm that the backup has been created. <br />

<h2> Step 2: Previewing the Backup File </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To confirm the contents of the backup archive and ensure all critical files and directories have been included before proceeding with verification and storage. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> After creating the backup, I will use the <b>less</b> command to preview the files and directories contained within the archive. This step ensures the backup accurately captures the intended data. <br />

<h2> Step 3: Listing Archives in the Backup Directory </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To identify and locate the appropriate backup archive that may contain the missing patient files. This step ensures I work with the correct archive during the restoration process. <br />
<b>My Action: </b>  I will use the <b>ls</b> command to display all available backup archives stored in the backup directory. <br />
<p align="center">

<h2> Step 4: Restoring the Backup </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To recover the missing patient files from the identified backup archive, ensuring they are accessible for review and verification by the pharmacy technician. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> Once Iâ€™ve identified the correct backup archive containing the missing files, I will extract entire backup archive using the <b>tar -xvf</b> command and focus specifically on the patients files that are missing. <br />

<h2> Step 5: Listing Files from the Restored Directory </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To verify that the extracted files from the backup archive have been successfully restored to the designated directory and to confirm their availability for review. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> After restoring the files, I will use the <b>ls -l</b> command to list all files and directories within the restored directory. This will help ensure that the missing patient files are present and accounted for. <br />

<h2> Step 6: Listing Folders to Be Backed Up in the testenvir Directory </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To establish a clear understanding of the existing directory structure and verify the files and folders that need to be included in the backup process. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> I will use the <b>ls -l</b> command to list all the files and subdirectories within the testenvir directory. This ensures that I capture the current state of the directory before performing the backup. <br />

<h2> Step 7: Backing Up Directories with Incremental Backup </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To create a backup of the testenvir directory using an incremental approach, ensuring that only new or modified files are captured after the initial full backup. This approach optimizes storage and reduces redundancy. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> I will perform a level 0 (full) backup to capture the entire testenvir directory. This serves as the baseline for all subsequent incremental backups. <br />

<h2> Step 8: Verifying Backup Status </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To confirm that the backup process was successful and validate the integrity of both the full and incremental backups. This step ensures that all intended files have been accurately captured and can be restored when needed. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> Verify the contents of the full backup archive by using the <b>tar -tvf</b> command piped through <b>less</b> to preview the files. <br />

<h2> Step 9: Simulating Cyberattack by Removing the Patient Directory from testenvir Directory
Purpose </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> o simulate a data loss scenario, such as a cyberattack or accidental deletion, by removing the patient directory from the testenvir directory. This test validates the recovery process and ensures that the backup system can effectively restore lost data. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> I will confirm the presence of the patient directory in the testenvir directory using the <b>ls</b> command. After confirmation, I will delete the patient directory and all associated files using the <b>rm -r</b> to simulate the loss of data during an attack. Finally, I will verify that the patient directory is missing using the <b>ls</b> command. <br />

<h2> Step 10: Restoring the Patient Directory from the Backup </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To recover the deleted patient directory from the most recent backup. This step ensures that lost data can be restored seamlessly in the event of a real-world cyberattack or accidental deletion. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> I will navigate to the testenvir parent directory to ensure the backup restoration occurs in the correct location. After that, I restore the patient directory from the full backup archive. Then finally, I verify that the patient directory has been restored <br />

<h2> Step 11: Testing Incremental Backup by Creating New Files </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To simulate changes to the system by adding new files to the patient directory. This test ensures that the incremental backup process captures these changes without duplicating unchanged data. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> I create three new files using the <b>touch</b> command to simulate updates or additions to the directory. I list the contents of the patient directory to verify the new files have been created. <br />

<h2> Step 12: Backing Up New Files with Incremental Backup </h2>
<b>Purpose: </b> To test the incremental backup process by capturing only the newly created files within the patient directory. This ensures the backup system is efficient and can record updates without duplicating unchanged data. <br />
<b>My Action: </b> I run the incremental backup targeting the changes in the testenvir/patient directory to backup the new files added. <br />
